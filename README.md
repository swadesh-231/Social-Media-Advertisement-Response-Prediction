# Social-Media-Advertisement-Response-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the response to social media advertisements using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify whether a user will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary.

Project Highlights:
- Uses the SVM algorithm for binary classification.
- Performs feature scaling to ensure proper training of the model.
- Divides the dataset into training and test sets for evaluation.
- Generates a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
- Visualizes the results through scatter plots and contour plots.
